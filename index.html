                 This website is all about our class 10C of EUROSCHOOL HSR.
                 Our class is one of the best classes in the grade, we had
                 a lot of fun this year.We did a lot of exciting stuff like
                 our special assembly for ganesh chaturti or the decoration
                 we did for diwali celebrations. We all could express our talents out
                 and not to forget about our wonderful and sweetest class 
                 teacher Hema ma'am. She is been really supportive through out
                 the entire year. From all us thank you so much ma'am for your support. You have always been there
                 for us whenever we want. You're the best teacher, not even kidding. You brought all the talents out from all of us..
                 The talent shows you have conducted during CT of everyday was an amazing idea!! I'm sure that I'm going to miss this class pretty much after our boards.
                 I have made a lot of good friends from this class and hopefully we all don't lose contact after our 10th grade is done.

                    The opportunity for the special assembly as we were told was given only to our class so even
                     though we had very less time to begin with, we made the most out of it and put on a great show!!... 
                     We practiced together and ended up doing a great job. Another great thing about the assembly was the 
                     fact that it showcased so many amazing talents in our class from acting to dancing, singing and playing 
                     instruments. 
                    Everyone commended us for our efforts and the fun we had in the process is something worth reminiscing.

                    Oh and how can we forget that one time it was Hema ma'am's birthday and we went all out!!..
                    We took a little contribution from everyone in our class and bought her a cake for the occasion. 
                    Everyone even helped decorate our class with balloons and it was such a pleasant surprise for ma'am. 
                    The way we all worked together for her is truly memorable! Also a huge thanks to Archana ma'am for 
                    playing along with us and keeping hema ma'am occupied while we hurried to decorate... She's the best!!
